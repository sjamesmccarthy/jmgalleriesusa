    "title": "Watkins Window",
    "desc": "Before there were paved roads, motorized vehicles, well marked trails and Ansel Adams, there were early pioneers, cabins in the woods and landscapes of the beautiful Yosemite Valley never seen before. Carleton Watkins, an American photographer, was one of the early pioneers of Yosemite in 1861 and it is said that Senator John Conness passed Watkins' photographs around Congress which influenced President Abraham Lincoln to sign the Yosemite Grant in 1864 that declared Yosemite Valley inviolable. This view, now known as Tunnel View, is what Watkins may have looked at when looking out the front window of a cabin (if there was one); talk about an amazing view.",

    "details": "Details: The image is approx. 11 x 14 inches mounted recycled palette boards giving it an overall size of approx. 16 x 20 inches. The image is also framed with thin, splinted pieces of the paletes for the visual feeling of looking out a cabin window. It was adhered to the boards and then hand-roughed-up using sand paper to create an old, classic and vintage feel as if you a looking out of a very old wooden cabin somewhere in Yosemite.This piece is considered extremely limited by the artist as only 1 was made.",
