The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance.
-- Ansel Adams

"The arts equally have distinct departments, and unless photography
has its own possibilities of expression, separate from those of the other
arts, it is merely a process, not an art."
- Alfred Stieglitz

"No man has the right to dictate what other men should perceive, create
or produce, but all should be encouraged to reveal themselves, their
perceptions and emotions, and to build confidence in the creative spirit."
- Ansel Adams

My Artist Statement
Take a moment and explore why I create. Explore my hidden crush of everyday, fine-art landscape photography that seduced my heart for the outdoors into a passion to tell the story around us, connect the human experience and for a moment dream with our eyes open.
