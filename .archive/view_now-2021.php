                <h4>Santa Claus is Coming To Town, Happy New Year!</h4>
                <p>
                    Yep, it's that time of year already.<br />
                    Time for crowds, last minute shopping and eggnog; lot's of eggnog.<br />
                    Also, quick note there will be no Christmas cards sent this year. This year will be Christmas With The Kranks, well because Thanksgiving turned out to be quite the f*k up.
                    <br /><br />
                    And since I am expecting Christmas will burn a lot of my free-time this month so I don't have many plans for my photography or youtube channel. Will most likely slow-down my release schedule for YouTube and concentrate on taking photos this Holiday with a trip to Las Vegas planned.
                    <br /><br />

                    <h4>What happened to October?</h4>
                <p>
                   Let's start with baseball.<br />
                   We at least beat the Yankees. Had a chance to beat the Astros until E-Rod f* it up with his little Correa watch tap. Well I guess when you poke the bear, the bear is going to sure as hell, poke back. And that they did, sweeping us the next 2 games to win the ALCS.
                   <br /><br />
                   What happened to October again? Oh yeah. We lost. Rest of the month forgotten.
                   <br /><br />
                    Honestly I really thought all this pandemic fear-living would be over by now. I am starting to seriously wonder how the human race survived this long alongside germs or whether this fear-demic is now (even more so) politically driven by the ever-growing progressive movement in America. We still have the left campaigning on vaccines and face-masks when the right is, for the most-part, polar opposite. Which is more accurately representing the truth of the situation I honestly don't know. Frankly the politics over this "pandemic" scare me more than germs themselves because of the sociological and mental affects.
                    <br /><br />
                    So, with that said, I have decided to once again slow my re-entry into events. It's not the fear of getting sick, it's the fear of misguiding authority and the rampant abuse of the power of politics. I don't want to be part of this progressive-sociological experiment and simply refuse to partake. I will find another way with less manipulation, bias and emotional conditioning to connect with my audience until these crazy times pass. Every storm eventually comes to an end .. right.
                    <br /><br />
                    I am also pumping the brakes a little on the YouTube channel. Only going to be creating 1 video a week but also include a Field Note on the same topic and post over on the blog. For the most part it's an issue of finding the time right now, and with the Holidays fast approaching there will be even less free-time hanging around. Hopefully by March 2022 I can get back to the 2 videos per week again.
                    <br /><br />
                    I also recently updated the online catalog with new pricing to reflect some new choices when it comes to paper, acrylic and metal, as well as size offerings. You can take a look by reading the <a href="/styles">Styles and Sizing page</a>.

                    <p>
                   October has come fast this year, and so have the cooler temps. Mornings have already been dropping into the 30s and highs hovering around mid 70s lately with an occasional mid-80s now and then. The upside of the earlier and cooler weather is that the fires are all pretty much subsiding and the air quality is finally back to normal for the first time since July making much more enjoyable to do outdoor activities again.

                   October 11 marks the first day, albeit light flurries, that it snowed in Carson City for 2020.1</span>

                    Recently I updated <a href="/">jmgalleries.com</a> with a dark mode. It's nice to look at a dark contrast against some of the photos when you want. It was a feature I worked on maybe last year, but for some reason didn't push it live. Now it's live for everyone to enjoy and play with.
                    <br /><br />
                    Since finishing Ready Player Two I decided I wasn't going to commit to another book for 2020.1 and instead just keep on flipping the pages of Daily Routines. Maybe I will pick up something small, but the rest of 2020.1 is going to be busy and I'm just not sure how much time I will be able to dedicate to reading.
                    <br /><br />
                    Almost done with the first phase! and just in time for winter; LOL. The fire-pit area will still get some use through the cold days, but looking forward to using it all next spring. It certainly was a lot of work (and weekends) getting it to where it is but it looks fabulous and will be amazing to use.
                    <br /><br />
                       I can't believe that we actually beat the Yankees in the wild-card one and done tie-breaker game and just clobbered the Rays in Game 2 of the ALDS, 14-6 with 5 Homers in a playoff game. Now the series is heading back to Fenway and tied up at 1-1.  <span class="update--label update--label-color-purple">Mon, 11 Oct 2021</span> <span class="update--color-purple">Red Sox do it again in Game 3 and beat the Rays 6-4.

We beat the Tampa Bay Rays 6-5. It was a close, back to back bash but my Red Sox landed the last punch and are heading to Houston to face the Astros in the 2021 ALCS on October 15!</span>

                    Last month, I kicked off a new playlist on my YouTube channel called "Thoughts While Drinking Coffee...". They started out as  short, 3 minutes or less, videos of me talking about photography things, but have been averaging closer to 4-6 minutes lately. I guess I am feeling more talkative. The most recent topic I jabbered on was NFTs.  <a target="_new" href="https://vlog.jmgalleries.com">Check them out on YouTube</a>.  Also, you can help by subscribing!
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm still not accepting pre-orders for my first photo-book, Untitled. This is mostly because of time and I also decided to switch back to Capture One 21. It wasn't a difficult migration back but for some odd reason I didn't keep any of the catalog files and squirreled me into a project I really didn't think I needed to work on: backup strategy. About a week later, I had a new backup strategy in place using Arq7 for MacOS, my Synology Raid 1, a few external hard drives and Google Cloud Storage (Archival class). I think I will probably write a field note about this so keep coming back. Also, f  ollow me on <a target="_new" href="https://twitter.com/jmgalleriesusa">Twitter</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://vlog.jmgalleries.com">YouTube</a> to stay up to date on when that exciting bit of news will officially drop.

                    <span class="update--label update--label-color-orange">Sun, 19 Sep 2021</span><span class="update--color-orange">Finished! I think my biggest problem with this book was that I felt like it was written for a movie and not a book. There were some really good parts, but 65% of it I felt was too similar to the first book with poor character evolution. The ending-ending could have been completely left out and I would have been satisfied as a reader, but it was perfect setup for a third-movie. I am mostly disappointed in reading this sequel.</span>
                    Argh, I am still reading the sequel to "Ready, Player One" titled "Ready, Player Two" which I started it back in January. I didn't make any progress and hope to finish by the end of the year and officially make it the ONLY book I read in 2021. That's terrible isn't it. I did download a sample of Walter Issacson's Steve Jobs biography and hope to get started sometime soon after I finish RP2.
                <br /><br />
                    It's begun! Finally, we finished the first phase of our backyard patio project and it looks fabulous! Over the weekend we started the second phase, hoping to complete the backyard paver project before the winter cold. How many phases are there? 4 I think.
                <br /><br />
                    Yep, the season is over for us. <span class="update--label update--label-color-orange">Sun, 19 Sep 2021</span><span class="update--color-orange">We may be wild-card opportunists, but I just don't see this version of the team (once again mostly pitching) post-season worthy. This seasons Red Sox collapse is a direct result of poor pitching management. I think it's time for Dave Bush to find a new team.</span>  Hopefully I will come read these words in a month and be wrong, but I don't think I will. 10 games behind now since the All-Star break when we had a 3.5 game lead in first-place. Good grief; that's baseball.

                    <p>
                    Old cars and 100 degree weather are here for 2021. It officially kicked off last weekend (August 1) in Virginia City, Nevada and will end on Sunday August 8. If it wasn't so smokey again I probably would have taken the short trip up to Reno and done a little old-car shooting and maybe found a food truck to have lunch at. However, with AQIs reaching in the upper 100s the air quickly becomes pretty miserable to breathe. But I was able to still catch a few of the classic cars in VC and am now looking forward to the Great Reno Balloon Race next month as well as cleaning air and blue skies.
                 <br /><br />
                    This is going to sound like a broken record, but again, the smokey air is being a real nuisance this summer for my lungs and my lens. Last weekend (first weekend of August) we had a break and took a short trip up the Tahoe where we hiked to Monkey Rock. I got a few keepers on the trip which you can <a target="_new" href="https://instagram.com/jmgalleriesusa">see on my Instagram</a> and picked one for my <a href="/oceans-lakes-waterfalls/big-sky">August New Release</a>.

                    Still reading the sequel to "Ready, Player One" back in January. I have made some progress and hope to finish it soon, but honestly it's not as engaging as the first book and taking some real energy.
                    <br /><br />
                    The month of July was extremely slow going because of, yep, you guessed it, the smoke. Working outside in 95 degree weather is tough enough, but add an unhealthy AQI of 160+ and it's just down-right miserable, so Michele and I took a break. Hopefully this month will improve and we will be able to enjoy our new paver patio before winter. As progress is made pics will come, or links to pics will come. Fingers crossed AQI improves and those wildfires burning nearby us (Dixie, Tammarack and River) are finally contained.
                    <br /><br />
                    For the first time in a month, my Red Sox have fallen out of first place. Excited to see Chris Sale back on the mound this coming weekend (8/14) and hope to see our guys start hitting again and reclaim first place!

                    So far this summer has been HOT! <span class="update--label update--label-color-orange">Sat, 17 Jul 2   021</span><span class="update--color-orange">And the wildfires have been popping up all around us, but the closest one, the <a target="_new" href="https://www.kolotv.com/2021/07/16/tamarack-fire-burning-south-markleeville/">Tamarack Fire</a> has burned almost 21,000 acres with no containment and making the air quality pretty ugly and unhealthy (AQI of 175).</span> Back on the 4th, we headed up to the old mining town of Virginia City, Nevada for the parade. It was my first time to this parade and always find this small, historic town charming and fun. Grabbed a beer at Virginia City Brewing and watched the parade from the street. I took a few pictures which you can see here in my <a target="_new" href="https://jmgalleries.com/fieldnotes/independence-day-parade-in-virginia-city-nevada">fieldnotes filmstrip</a>. <span class="update--label update--label-color-green">Sun, 18 Jul 2021 </span> <span class="update--color-green">Also, been creating a lot of new youtube videos, so if you haven't seen any, go check them out <a target="_new" href="//vlog.jmgalleries.com">on my youtube channel</a>.</span>

                    Despite the temps creeping at the 100 mark and sometimes tipping over, we finally started our backyard patio. I must have rearranged a hundred or so pavers (2/3 times) like I was playing Tetris as we played with pattern ideas. We figured it out and now it's time to put in the work. And, hopefully we will get a few weeks to enjoy it before winter. <span class="update--label update--label-color-purple">Thu, 29 Jul 2021 </span> <span class="update--color-purple">The smoke from the Tamarack and Dixie fires have unfortunately slowed progress on the backyard paver project.

                    It feels like eons ago was the last time I fired up "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" (that's our Traeger name). This past month has just been too hot to BBQ. Plus, we recently started using Home Chef and have made some really amazing meals with that subscription. But, I'm starting feel a craving for some tri-tip and beef ribs. Maybe some fresh coleslaw too.

                    On the first day of the month I got a call wondering if I had the time to shoot a wedding ... on the same day. I rearranged a few things on the schedule, tossed together some gear and by lunch time I was heading to Genoa. It felt great to get back behind the camera in a way where I wasn't shooting clouds, water or trees and also interacting with people; real people, not people in a Zoom call. I could actually shake their hands and have a human connection. You can check out some of the wedding highlights on <a target="_new" href="https://jmgalleries.pixieset.com/angela-jonathan/">my portfolio site</a>.

                    I also switched sending the once-a-month new release email to the First Friday of each month. Small change, but I think attaching it to a more popular event title will make it more attractive to look forward to.

                    Other than my typical headline flipping on Apple News and browsing opinions on Medium, I started the sequel to "Ready, Player One" back in January. Any guesses on the title? "<a target="_new"  href="https://amzn.to/3evWfzE">Ready, Player Two</a>". Haha, however, I'm not doing a very good job at making progress since I am only about half way through. You may think that's because it's not a very engaging book. It honestly has a feel like it was written specifically to be turned into a movie. There was way too much early recap/build up to the actual plot of the second story.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have also been trying to make it part of my daily routine to read a few snips from Mason Curry's book, "<a target=")new" href="https://amzn.to/3rjkhTl">Daily Rituals</a>", while I have my coffee and check email.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have been watching the new Marvel series, Loki. It's good. Both entertaining and a little thought provoking in terms of the MCU. As of today, however, there is still one more episode left and am excited about it. As far as movies go I finally watched Disney's Cruella. I liked it; not loved it. I hope they don't make a sequel. In the prime-time network world who isn't watching Holey Moley Season 3? If you haven't seen this fun, funny and crazy ultimate miniature golf game show then I strongly encourage you to look it up on Hulu and start. Oh, and Lego Masters too (Season 2). And, of course the filler shows being Moonshiners, American Ninja Warrior, Insane Pools, Bahamas Life and The American Barbecue ShowDown.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm not really a fan or believer of the  mantra, "Go Big or Go Home", within the fine-art community. Maybe it's because I don't have a home or office that can accommodate super-large imagery or that I don't have a medium format camera which would more easily allow me to create larger-than-life images. This is why I tend to keep my fine-art in the medium (16x24) to large (24x36) size and leave the ginormous to photographers who have the space and gear. With that said, I have been working on bringing some new ideas to the art-collection community which I hope to start showing-off by the end of year ... somewhere, most likely Reno/Tahoe area.
                    <br /><br />

                    The last event I was at exhibiting my photography was Art of the Walls in Temecula, California on November 2019. It's been too long to say the least and lately I have been scouting some art shows in the Reno/Tahoe area with great potential to start back up in the summer of 2022.
                    <br /><br />
                    However, I also received an email from the City of Temecula recently and they re-opened their applications for Art of Walls which might be something I will consider for coming fall. It would be nice to talk to people about my photography again and sell a piece or two.
