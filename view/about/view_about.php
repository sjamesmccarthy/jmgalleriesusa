                    <p class="name-statement">
                    Take a moment and look into why I create; explore my passion with everyday, fine-art photography. Let my composition seduce your heart with a story wanting to be told to you, then, for a moment, catch yourself dreaming with your eyes open while you listen to the voice of my art.
