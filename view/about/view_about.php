                    Take a moment and explore why I create.<br />
                    James' color and black and white photography portrays his journey as an artist in photography over the past 10 years and how he has adjusted his style and perspective of fine-art photography from being a simple photograph to an art form that will inspire your curiosity and share a story that your memory awakens, or take you on a journey to a place you have never been.

                    Photography has always had a hidden crush on James, a self-taught explorer in the field of landscape photography. Through his purposeful paper choice, framing, composition and visual intention through post-processing, James will inspire you to take a moment and explore why he chases mother nature, adoring the beauty which she scatters throughout our world: majestic waterfalls and serene ocean coasts, mountains, deserts and trees to flowers, fields and meadows. Let James' photography inspire your curiosity so that you might hear the voice of his art share a story that your memory awakens, or take you on a journey to a place you have never been.

                    <p class="">
                    Born in Concord, Massachusetts, a small suburb outside Boston, James grew up exploring the colorful landscape of the east coast as well as its rich history teaching him to appreciate the stories which the surroundings still have to share. Then, in the late 80's his family travelled 2,977 miles West and settled in Auburn, California where he began to discover his creative passions for writing and photography.
                    </p> -->

                    <!-- <p class="">
                    While on a northwest college road trip with his mother, Alice, he was photographing a foggy dock somewhere off Hwy 299 outside of Arcata using a hand-me-down Minolta SLR 35mm camera given to him by his 8th grade Journalism teacher, Mrs. Anderson. This was the moment James and his camera "clicked".

                    <!-- <p class="">
                    After attending the University of Nevada Reno, James made the beautiful state of Nevada his home base for nearly thirty years. He currently resides in a small town nestled against the Sierra Nevada Mountains and in the shadows of Lake Tahoe, Carson City.
