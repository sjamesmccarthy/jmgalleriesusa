You know, the shot that would define the moment, that you would love without really understanding why other than just looking at and being around it made you feel good. And like most things that are unexpected, this shot was one of them. Taking the long way one afternoon this tree caught the corner of my eye at 60mph. A quick u-turn and it was staring me in the face and I have been forever lost in the "Serendipity" of its story.';
