This was no ordinary bird. Delivered to the USAAF on July 22, 1944, the now 75 year old "Starduster" was designed as a strategic bomber. The Boeing B-17, also known as the Flying Fortress, was more than just your typical plane with bombs. The four engine bomber carried a 5,000 to 8,000 bomb load and was armed with 13 .50 caliber heavy machine guns. She certainly danced with her share of stars in the sky and saw many landscapes while flying numerous campaigns in Europe during the Second World War. Now, restored to her 1944 greatness, she shines at the March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California.';
