After walking around this beautiful campus just before sunset, I finally came to the front-gate and a "closed" sign stared back at me. I stood there, blank faced and let down when a security guard approached and asked if I\'d like a tour. Of course I replied "are you joking?" There was only 1 rule he said: "No tripods". He escorted me to the well-known and well-photographed courtyard and there, with my tripod benched, I got a few shots of this architecturally renowned campus that unifies the sky, sea and science and once a year during the Winter Solstice the river of life aligns directly with an ocean sunset.';
