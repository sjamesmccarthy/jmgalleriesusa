                <h3>Lip Smakin' Good BBQ Ribs!</strike></h3>
                    <p>
                    Labor Day weekend kicked off with the Nugget's Best In The West rib Cook-off in Sparks. It has been 5 years since I last attended this event and wow how it has grown. Although the number of Master BBQers smokin'  ribs was about what I remembered, the art and craft vendors easily tripled in number. Ate some great ribs and even took a full slab home for dinner from what we enjoyed most: Brother's BBQ from Reno.

                    September has also started out with much better air quality, averaging out at around mid 100 lately. However the Caldor fire erupted last week and headed straight for South Lake Tahoe. All of the South Lake was evacuated and that side of Lake Tahoe was basically closed to everyone except those fighting the fires. I haven't yet read about the damage specific to SL but the Caldor fire itself has destroyed over 1,000 structures and as of 9/7 48% contained.

                <h3>Photography, YouTube and Fine-Art ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    last month, I kicked off a new playlist on my YouTube channel called "Thoughts While Drinking Coffee...". They started out as  short, 3 minutes or less, videos of me talking about photography things, but have been averaging closer to 4-6 minutes lately. I guess I am feeling more talkative. The most recent topic I jabbered on was NFTs.  <a target="_new" href="https://vlog.jmgalleries.com">Check them out on YouTube</a>.  Also, you can help by subscribing!

                    I'm still not accepting pre-orders for my first photo-book, Untitled. This is mostly because of time and I also decided to switch back to Capture One 21. It wasn't a difficult migration back but for some odd reason I didn't keep any of the catalog files and squirreled me into a project I really didn't think I needed to work on: backup strategy. About a week later, I had a new backup strategy in place using Arq7 for MacOS, my Synology Raid 1, a few external hard drives and Google Cloud Storage (Archival class). I think I will probably write a field note about this so keep coming back. Also, f  ollow me on <a target="_new" href="https://twitter.com/jmgalleriesusa">Twitter</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://vlog.jmgalleries.com">YouTube</a> to stay up to date on when that exciting bit of news will officially drop.

                <h3>Reading ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    Argh, I am still reading the sequel to "Ready, Player One" titled "Ready, Player Two" which I started it back in January. I didn't make any progress and hope to finish by the end of the year and officially make it the ONLY book I read in 2021. That's terrible isn't it. I did download a sample of Walter Issacson's Steve Jobs biography and hope to get started sometime soon after I finish RP2.

                <h3>Backyard ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    It's begun! Finally, we finished the first phase of our backyard patio project and it looks fabulous! Over the weekend we started the second phase, hoping to complete the backyard paver project before the winter cold. How many phases are there? 4 I think.

                <h3>Baseball ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    Yep, the season is over for us. Hopefully I will come read these words in a month and be wrong, but I don't think I will. 10 games behind now since the All-Star break when we had a 3.5 game lead in first-place. Good grief; that's baseball.
