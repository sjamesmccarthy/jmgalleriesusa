                   Let's start with baseball.<br />
                   We at least we beat the Yankees. Had a chance to beat the Astros until E-Rod f* it up with his little Correa watch tap. Well I guess when you poke the bear, the bear is going to sure as hell, poke back. And that they did, sweeping us the next 2 games to win the ALCS.

                   <b>Fast Forward to November.</b><br />
                   What happened to October again? Oh yeah. We lost. Rest of the month forgotten.

                    Honestly I really thought all this pandemic fear-living would be over by now. I am starting to seriously wonder how the human race survived this long alongside germs or whether this fear-demic is now politically driven. We still have the left campaigning on vaccines and face-masks when the right is polar opposite. Which is more accurately representing the truth of the situation I honestly don't know but can't believe that we have somehow as a race survived this long by having to wear a mask everywhere because as history shows we have not. Frankly the politics over this scare me more than germs themselves. 
                    <br /><br />
                    So, with that said, I have decided to once again slow down my re-entry into events. It's not the fear of getting sick, it's the fear of misguiding authority and the rampant abuse of the power of politics. I don't want to be part of this socialist experiment and refuse to partake. I will find another way with less manipulation, bias and emotional conditioning to connect with my audience until these crazy times pass. Every storm eventually comes to an end.
