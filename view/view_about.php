                            Creativity and art have always had a hidden crush on me, a self-taught explorer in the field of landscape and digital photography. Through purposeful paper choice, framing and composition, I aspire for my artwork to take you on a journey to a place you once remember or a place of new discovery and connect you with the human experience.

            <p>
            Born in Concord, a small, historical, suburb outside Boston, Massachusetts, j.McCarthy explored the rich history of the makings of America during his youth.  He learned to appreciate the beauty and stories that are shared by the landscape around us. From as far East as Boston where America's freedom was founded when Paul Revere galloped over cobble-stone rock on his candle-lit "midnight ride" yelling, "The British are coming!" to as far-away West into the Gold Rush of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

            Twelve years later, his parents sold the east coast homestead and packed everyone into a white Subaru wagon -- a traveling cat named "buffy" separated him and his younger sister, Stacey, in the backseat -- and they journeyed 2,977 miles across America to began a new adventure in a small Northern California town at the crossroads of Highway 49 and Interstate 80 known as <a href="https://www.sierranevadageotourism.org/content/city-of-auburn-no-404-california-historical-landmark/sied6970ba03ce993f0d" target="_new">"North Fork Dry Diggins"</a>, or Auburn, as it was renamed in 1849.

                    While on a northwest college road tour with his mother he was shooting a foggy dock on a lake somewhere in the boonedocks outside of Eugene, Oregon with a hand-me-down Minolta SLR 35mm camera that was given to him by his 8th grade Journalism teacher, Mrs. Anderson. This was the moment j.McCarthy heard his calling, inspiring him to pursue a career in Journalism.

                    <p>
                    As they say, "time flies" and "life happens". j.McCarthy graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1994 with a Bachelors degree in Liberal Arts, was blessed with three beautiful daughters.</p>
                    <p>In 2012, he moved back to the Sacramento area where he was reunited with long time friend, and fellow fine-art photographer, <a href="http://steveroyjr.com/" target="_new">Steve Roy</a>. Steve inspired j.McCarthy to pick-up his camera, a Nikon 1 V1 at the time, and start looking through the lens again. It wasn't too long after when j.McCarthy took his desire to master fine-art photography up a new level and upgraded to a Nikon D5200.  Not a few months later, he graduated into the full-frame world with Nikon's D600 and him and Steve could often be discovered road-tripping through Napa to the Pacific Ocean, shooting up and down the Northern California Coast.</p>
                    <p>With Steve's encouragement, he launched a website showcasing his work, which at that time was primarily black and white photography.

                    <p>
                    After moving back to the Reno/Tahoe area in 2015, j.McCarthy met his better-half, Michele, who after seeing his work, inspired him to start publicly displaying and selling his photographs.

                    <p>
                    In June of 2016 his first photos, printed on metal, were displayed at a local tap-house, Beer NV, in Reno, Nevada. Soon after was his first sale, Between The Hills. Not long after that, a gallery showing in Carson City, Nevada at the Brewery Arts Center with the Nevada Artists Association.</p>
                    
                    <p>In early 2016, j.McCarthy started hand-making his own frames out of dark Walnut and continued showing and selling new artwork through out the area.

                    <p>
                    In summer of 2017, j.McCarthy relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada.

                    <p>
                        Turning the page and beginning a new chapter was the start to opening new doors for j.McCarthy beginning with a new place to exhibit his photography in Henderson, Nevada. The locally owned, Joe Maxx Coffee Company welcomed j.McCarthy into both of their Las Vegas area coffee houses where he displayed over 40 pieces of fine-art between their two locations. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        2018 was also the start of an infatuation with Art Off The Walls, a first-Friday event in Temecula, California where j.McCarthy had the opportunity to share his passion of landscape photography with the backwoods of San Diego, California, but it wasn't all about exhibiting.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Lots of back of the studio changes happened too, from the addition of new gear, including, Tamron G2 lenses, a Macbook Pro, Synology NAS backup solutions, framing equipment and suppliers, to the purchase of an Epson SureColor P800. j.McCarthy overhauled his entire workflow creating his own turn-key studio, as well as migrated his digital darkroom from Adobe's Lightroom to Phase One's Capture One Pro.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The next year came in the blink of an eye, and to kick-off 2019, j.McCarthy announced with a 3 month exhibit at the Temecula Public Library in Temecula, California. He closed out the year launching a new website and announcing a move to Southern California.

                    <p>It was the beginning of a new chapter in Southern California, or so it was supposed to have been. After a few months in transition, and because of unforeseen circumstances, the adventure ended as quickly as it had begun and j.McCarthy found himself back in Las Vegas. Not a week later, the global pandemic known as COVID-19 cancelled everything in 2020. <!-- (aka Coronavirus, aka a really severe Flu which attacked elderly and those with respiratory conditions) swept the world in haste, starting at ground-zero in Wuhan China. The virus quickly infected almost a million people and killing hundreds of thousands world-wide, but the economic shutdown and media-induced panic is what ultimately hurt more lives. Entire states, cities and countries were put on complete lock-down or shelter-in-place orders by their Government officials in fear of an unknown death-toll which the media was comparing to the Black Plague of 1346. The US economy came to a halt. Unemployment grew to over 30% in some States; numbers like this have not been seen since the Great Depression. That was March, April and May. By June, people still kept to themselves inside afraid to breath the air outside even though it's perfectly safe. Riots and protests ensued around the globe further hurting any economic recovery attempting to ignite. The only thing for certain right now is that we have a very long road back to normalcy. -->

                    In September, j.McCarthy relocated back to the Carson/Tahoe area.
