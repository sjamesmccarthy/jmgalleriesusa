     <li><h4>Styles</h4>
        <p>James' Fine Art Photography represents his passion for the outdoors and life around him. His style is best described as a timeless, clean and natural view of the world around him. It is rare that you will find any of James' photography enhanced by saturated color, artificial light or significantly edited in a way to alter that moment of time  <a href="/about">...</a></p>

        <ol>
         
            <li><h4>Framing</h4>
                <p>Gallery and Studio Editions can be optionally framed. All of our frames are hand-made from Bass, Ash and Dark Walnut woods that are sourced from a Los Angeles, California mill. They are stained or painted and include a wire hanger for easy hanging. Since each frame is custom made to order, prices will vary depending on size, type of wood and finishing.</p>
                <p>Frames do not include glass. This is because James believes that standard frame glass as well as non-glare glass distorts the color and texture of the art, whether a painting or a photograph. </p>
