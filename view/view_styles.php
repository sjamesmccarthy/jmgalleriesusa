                <p>Gallery and Studio Editions can be optionally framed.</p>
                
                <p><b>Hand-made Studio Frames</b><p>
                <p>
                Studio Editions are mounted in a hand-made frame with quality wood that is sourced from a Los Angeles, California mill in the USA. They are stained or painted and include a wire hanger for easy hanging. Frames do not include glass. This is because j.McCarthy believes that standard frame glass as well as non-glare glass distorts the color and texture of the paper and art.
