    <h1>Styles, Editions & Pricing</h1>
    <p class="artists-statement padbot-30">James' work in the world of Fine Art Photography represents his passion for the outdoors and life around him.

<ul class="subsection-ul">
    
    <li><h4>Limited Edition Photographs</h4>
        <p>All of James' Limited Edition Fine Art Photographs are printed on-demand and part of a unqiue series that is limited to 12 prints of any size. Each photograph is signed and includes a Certificate of Authenticity.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><h4>Artist Proof Photographs</h4>
        <p>An "Artist Proof" is, in practical theory, a single-printed version of a photograph to see the printing state, which will represent the finished work. Artist Proof's are typically not included in the count of any Limited Edition Series and have special value because of its differences from the finished, final print. Collector's often search for the Artist Proof editions because there are fewer available. All Artists Proof photographs are numbered and dated, and usually limited to no more than 5 printings and are of various sizes from 5x7 to 12x18. Each photograph is signed and includes a Certificate of Authenticity.
