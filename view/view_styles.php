                <li><p><b>ADD A FRAME</b><br />Add a 3/4" hand-made, wood frame to any Wall Mounted Print or Acrylic. Available in Ash Gray or Snowy White. Add $250 to price. *Glass is not included in any frame as this goes against James' stylistic credo that most standard glass covering photographs alter the preception and quality of the paper's properties that the image is printed and Acrylic prints do not require additional covering. </p></li>
                
                <!-- <li><p><b>ADD A MAT (REQUIRES A FRAME)</b><br />If you like to add a 3" mat to your artwork a custom size frame will need to be made and price will vary by size ($12 per foot).</p></li>  -->

                <!-- <li><p><b>FLOAT MOUNTED (INCLUDED)</b><br />Each print above, with exception to SMALL (Open Edition) prints include a 3/4" wood inset float frame that is attached to the back of the foam-core mounted print. Acrylic typically comes with an aluminum inset float frame.</p> -->

            <li><p class="smaller">*Some fine-art prints are not standard ratios and therefore will not fit standard frame or paper sizes and may have adjusted or different pricing per piece. Prices at pop-up galleries, such as Joe Maxx Coffee Co, Art Off The Walls @Temecula or Stoneyhead Brewing are "as-is-show-pieces; no returns".</p></li> -->
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Limited Edition Photographs</b><br />
        <p>All of James' Limited Edition Fine Art Photographs are part of a series which is curently limited to 12 and signed by James. There is no "premium or appreciation-level pricing", so if you purchase print #1 or print #500 the price is the same.</li>

    <li><b>Artist Proof Photographs</b>
    <p>An "Artist Proof" is, in practical theory, a single-printed version of a photograph to see the printing state, which will represent the finished work. Artist Proof's are typically not included in the count of any Limited Edition Series and have special value because of its differences from the finished, final print. Collector's often search for the Artist Proof editions because there are fewer available. All Artists Proof photographs are numbered and dated, and usually limited to no more than the first 5 printings.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li><b>Studio Proof Photographs</b>
            <p>Collectors, curators, historians and decorators often view studio proof photographs as the most desirable, and valuable, because of their rarity, uniqueness, and that they may have belonged to the artist himself. These editions of the work are typically one-of-a-kind working proofs where there are never more than five studio proofs ever made available for a photo.
            </p>
        </li>

        <!-- <li><b>House Collection</b>
            <p>These editions of the work are typically reserved for exhibits, pop-up galleries or James' personal collection. 
            </p>
        </li> -->

        <li><b>Open Edition Photographs</b>
