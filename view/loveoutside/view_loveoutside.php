        <h3>The Carson/Tahoe Group</h3>
        <p>As well as Reno, Sparks, Gardnerville, Minden, Dayton, Incline Village and other surrounding communities. </p>
        <p>Currently meeting every other month in one of the surrounding communities to discuss all things outdoors and photography as well as go on a short outdoor +photography related field-trip in the area.</p>
        
        <p>Next meeting is Saturday, June 4 in Carson City at Comma Coffee around 10am. We will meet up for an intro to the group and who we are, then will be taking a short field-trip up Prison Hill for some amazing vistas of the Carson Valley. <i>If you're interested, just show up, and, like the sunshine everything is free &mdash; except for the delicious Comma Coffee edibles.</i></p>

        <!-- <p>Our Q2 conservation goal is trail trash clean-up along the Carson river from Buzzy's Ranch Trailhead (Carson River Park)  north along the Carson River to where it intersects with the Mexican Ditch Trail at the golfcourse. Join us on Saturday, June 25 at 9AM at the Carson River Park Parking lot. Please bring your supplies to pick up trash. It should be an easy walk for about 2 hours. Even though we will be picking up trash don't forget your camera - spring has sprung along the river!</p> -->
