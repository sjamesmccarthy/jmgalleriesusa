                <h3> Wildfires Burning! <strike>Happy 4th of July!</strike></h3>
                    <p>
                    So far this summer has been HOT! <span class="update--label update--label-color-orange">Sat, 17 Jul 2   021</span><span class="update--color-orange">And the wildfires have been popping up all around us, but the closest one, the <a target="_new" href="https://www.kolotv.com/2021/07/16/tamarack-fire-burning-south-markleeville/">Tamarack Fire</a> has burned almost 21,000 acres with no containment and making the air quality pretty ugly and unhealthy (AQI of 175).</span> Back on the 4th, we headed up to the old mining town of Virginia City, Nevada for the parade. It was my first time to this parade and always find this small, historic town charming and fun. Grabbed a beer at Virginia City Brewing and watched the parade from the street. I took a few pictures which you can see here in my <a target="_new" href="https://jmgalleries.com/fieldnotes/independence-day-parade-in-virginia-city-nevada">fieldnotes filmstrip</a>. <span class="update--label update--label-color-green">Sun, 18 Jul 2021 </span> <span class="update--color-green">Also, been creating a lot of new youtube videos, so if you haven't seen any, go check them out <a target="_new" href="//vlog.jmgalleries.com">on my youtube channel</a>.</span>

                <h3>Home Projects</h3>
                    <p>
                    Despite the temps creeping at the 100 mark and sometimes tipping over, we finally started our backyard patio. I must have rearranged a hundred or so pavers (2/3 times) like I was playing Tetris as we played with pattern ideas. We figured it out and now it's time to put in the work. And, hopefully we will get a few weeks to enjoy it before winter. <span class="update--label update--label-color-purple">Thu, 29 Jul 2021 </span> <span class="update--color-purple">The smoke from the Tamarack and Dixie fires have unfortunately slowed progress on the backyard paver project. Hopefully the air quality will improve as fire crews contain the disaster.</span>

                <h3>What's Cooking ... on the Traeger</h3>
                    <p>
                    It feels like eons ago was the last time I fired up "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" (that's our Traeger name). This past month has just been too hot to BBQ. Plus, we recently started using Home Chef and have made some really amazing meals with that subscription. But, I'm starting feel a craving for some tri-tip and beef ribs. Maybe some fresh coleslaw too. 
                    <br /><br />

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p>
                    On the first day of the month I got a call wondering if I had the time to shoot a wedding ... on the same day. I rearranged a few things on the schedule, tossed together some gear and by lunch time I was heading to Genoa. It felt great to get back behind the camera in a way where I wasn't shooting clouds, water or trees and also interacting with people; real people, not people in a Zoom call. I could actually shake their hands and have a human connection. You can check out some of the wedding highlights on <a target="_new" href="https://jmgalleries.pixieset.com/angela-jonathan/">my portfolio site</a>.
                    <br /><br />
                    I also switched sending the once-a-month new release email to the First Friday of each month. Small change, but I think attaching it to a more popular event title will make it more attractive to look forward to. You can read the <a target="_new" href="https://mailchi.mp/ff463effb3c8/052021-nr-7072154">July First Friday New Release email</a> and <a target="_new" href="https://jmgalleries.com/signup">subscribe</a> so you don't want to miss August.

                    <span class="update--label update--label-color-purple">Thu, 29 Jul 2021 </span> <span class="update--color-purple">This week I kicked off a new playlist on my YouTube channel called "Thoughts While Drinking Coffee...". They are short, 3 minutes or less, videos of me talking about photography things. <a target="_new" href="https://vlog.jmgalleries.com">Check it out</a>.</span>
                    </p>
                    
                <h3>Reading ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    Other than my typical headline flipping on Apple News and browsing opinions on Medium, I started the sequel to "Ready, Player One" back in January. Any guesses on the title? "<a target="_new"  href="https://amzn.to/3evWfzE">Ready, Player Two</a>". Haha, however, I'm not doing a very good job at making progress since I am only about half way through. You may think that's because it's not a very engaging book. It honestly has a feel like it was written specifically to be turned into a movie. There was way too much early recap/build up to the actual plot of the second story.
                    <br /><br />
                    I have also been trying to make it part of my daily routine to read a few snips from Mason Curry's book, "<a target=")new" href="https://amzn.to/3rjkhTl">Daily Rituals</a>", while I have my coffee and check email.
                    </p>
                    
                <h3>What's on the television ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    I have been watching the new Marvel series, Loki. It's good. Both entertaining and a little thought provoking in terms of the MCU. As of today, however, there is still one more episode left and am excited about it. As far as movies go I finally watched Disney's Cruella. I liked it; not loved it. I hope they don't make a sequel. In the prime-time network world who isn't watching Holey Moley Season 3? If you haven't seen this fun, funny and crazy ultimate miniature golf game show then I strongly encourage you to look it up on Hulu and start. Oh, and Lego Masters too (Season 2). And, of course the filler shows being Moonshiners, American Ninja Warrior, Insane Pools, Bahamas Life and The American Barbecue ShowDown.

                <h3>Thinking about fine-art ...</h3>
                    <p>
                    I'm not really a fan or believer of the  mantra, "Go Big or Go Home", within the fine-art community. Maybe it's because I don't have a home or office that can accommodate super-large imagery or that I don't have a medium format camera which would more easily allow me to create larger-than-life images. This is why I tend to keep my fine-art in the medium (16x24) to large (24x36) size and leave the ginormous to photographers who have the space and gear. With that said, I have been working on bringing some new ideas to the art-collection community which I hope to start showing-off by the end of year ... somewhere, most likely Reno/Tahoe area. 
                    <br /><br />

                <h3>Calendar of Events</h3>
                    <p>
                    The last event I was at exhibiting my photography was Art of the Walls in Temecula, California on November 2019. It's been too long to say the least and lately I have been scouting some art shows in the Reno/Tahoe area with great potential to start back up in the summer of 2022. 
                    <br /><br />
                    However, I also received an email from the City of Temecula recently and they re-opened their applications for Art of Walls which might be something I will consider for coming fall. It would be nice to talk to people about my photography again and sell a piece or two. 
                    <br /><br />
                    <span class="update--label update--label-color-purple">Thu, 31 Jul 2021 </span> <span class="update--color-purple">Once again I am pressing pause on the hopes of being at an event any time in the remainder of 2021 and maybe even first half of 2022 now that our Progressive Liberal Government and Government influenced mainstream media is once again requiring masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I don't understand why the People expect and WANT the government to babysit them.</span>
